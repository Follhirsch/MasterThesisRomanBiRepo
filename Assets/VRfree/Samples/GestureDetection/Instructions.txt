The VRfree.dll has a built-in gesture detection. It can recognize two different types of gestures:

1) The static gesture defines a hand pose for a static (non moving) gesture. 
Weather or not a pose satisfies the StaticGesture is determined by the angle deviations
of the input pose to the centerPose in comparison to maxCloseAngleDeviation and maxSideAngleDeviation.
Additionally, fingers that do not play a part in the pose can be set to be ignored in ignoreFinger.
Finally, the angles of the hand relative to the lower arm are also taken into consideration if 
useWristHandAngles is true.

2) A multi gesture consists of multiple static gestures in succession with defined time-intervals between them.

Both types of gestures are defined and read by the dll on start-up from json files in the \Gestures\Static and
\Gestures\Multi folders in the path specified in "subfolder" in the GestureDetection script. The path specified 
in the script under "subfolder" is relative to "%appdata%/Sensoryx", but you can also give it absolute paths such 
as "C:\VRfreeGestures". While the json files are human readable and can be changed with any text editor, for now 
the best way to define new gestures is opening the GestureDetection Scene in the Samples folder of the provided 
Unity Examples in the Unity Editor (Samples are created with version 2019.2.6f1).

After opening the scene in the Editor press play, connect the gloves and calibrate them as usual. To record a 
static gesture, hold your right hand in the desired pose and press 'G'. When you select the GestureDetection object in 
the hierarchy on the left you should see the "GestureDetection (Script)" in the inspector. Click the little arrows next
to "Static Gestures Detected" and "Static Gestures" to expand them. When you repeat the gesture you recorded with your 
right hand, the box in "Static Gestures Detected" should become ticked. You can now adjust the properties of the gesture
under "Static Gestures". Set a name, for your gesture, adjust how easily the gesture is detected by changing 
MaxCloseAngleDeviation and MaxSideAngleDeviation, set ignoreFinger for fingers that don't take part in the gesture, 
set if the angles of the hand relative to the lower arm are also taken into consideration using useWristHandAngles.
Once you're satisfied with how the gesture is recognized, press the "Save Static Gestures" button. The json file defining 
the gestures will be found in the path specified under "subfolder" in the GestureDetection script. Note that there is a 
32 gestures limit, so once you reached that limit you'll first have to delete a gesture before adding a new one using the
"Remove Static/Multi Gesture at Index" buttons.

For multi gestures, the creation process is mostly the same, excep that you need multiple static gestures to define a
multi gesture. To start defining a multi gesture, move your hand in the desired starting pose and press 'M'. You then 
have 2 seconds of time to move to the next pose and press 'M' again. In this way, up to 8 poses can be chained together.
Once the time between two presses of the 'M' button are more than 2 seconds apart, a new multigesture is started.
The multigestures can be edited when expanded just like the static gestures and saved with the "Save Multi Gestures" button.
The time intervals specify the maximum amount of time that can pass between two consecutive poses, so that the multi gesture 
is still recognized.

Finally, if you want to use the static and multi gestures outside of unity with the dll, you just need to place the 
\Gestures\Static and \Gestures\Multi folder structure with json files in a folder and load them with 
VRfree.GestureAPI.LoadGestures(path). "path" should either be relative to "%appdata%/Sensoryx", or absolute strating
with a drive letter). These folders are created by the dll automatically if they don't exist, when it is run. For 
reference how to get the detected gestures from the dll refer to the GestureDetection.cs script.
