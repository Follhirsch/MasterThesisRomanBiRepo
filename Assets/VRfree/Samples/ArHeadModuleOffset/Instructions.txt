First make sure you can deploy an empty scene to the AR HMD of your chosing. For the Hololens 2 for example, you can follow the following tutorial:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/tutorials/mr-learning-base-02

Then, once you can deploy and run your project on your HMD, add the VRfree plugin. Add the camera prefab from your HMD's api to the ArHeadModuleOffset
scene. In the case of the Hololens, first disable the original camera transform, then select Mixed Reality->Toolkit->Add to scene and configure. 
Add the VRfreeCamera script to the main camera of the prefab and move the children of the "Camera" Gameobject which was originally in the scene to the 
new camera. You can then disable or delete the old camera object.
When building for UWP (Hololens 2), go to Project Settings->Player->UWP Settings->Publishing Settings->Capabilities and enable InternetClient, 
InternetClientServer, and PrivateNetworkClientServer. Delete all previous contents of build folder or build to new folder for settings to take effect.

To calibrate the system, start the latest VRfree Setup on your PC. Since most of the calibration routines there are for using the gloves/trackers on
the pc itself (not the AR headset), you only need to run the Head Module Orientation Calibration (with the head module mounted to the running AR HMD, 
but connected via USB to the PC) and the Glove/Tracker Orientation Calibrations.
The Head Module Offset Calibration and Hand Pose Calibration are included in the ArHeadModuleOffset scene and should later be run from there on the 
AR HMD itself. For the head module offset calibration look up to the "Calibrate Offset" sign and activate it. The calibration procedure will consecutively 
show 9 cyan 3d points which you need to match with the tracking dome on either one of your gloves or your tracker. Which of these is required for 
calibration can be set inside the Unity Editor in the ArHeadModuleOffsetCalibration script on the HeadModuleOffsetCalibration object under "Calibration Source".
